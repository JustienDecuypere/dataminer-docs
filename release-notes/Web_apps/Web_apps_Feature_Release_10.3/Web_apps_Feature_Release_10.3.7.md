### Fixes

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps - Line chart: X and Y axis labels would not show the correct text [ID_35943]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

The X and Y axis labels of a line chart would not show the correct text when the data was grouped.

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps: Components would prematurely consider themselves loaded [ID_36142]

<!-- MR 10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

In some cases, components would incorrectly consider themselves loaded while they were still loading. As a result, it would already be possible to execute actions on those components before those actions could be properly processed.

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps - Query builder: Select nodes would incorrectly not show the selected columns [ID_36251]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.7 -->

In the query builder, when a *Select* node was not in edit mode, its description would incorrectly not show the selected columns.

#### Dashboards app & Low-Code Apps: State component would incorrectly not be cleared when its input feed was cleared [ID_36261]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU16]/10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

In some cases, a *State* component would incorrectly not be cleared when its input feed was cleared.

#### Low-Code Apps: Table actions would incorrectly be executed before the rows were fed [ID_36263]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU16]/10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

In some cases, table actions would be executed before the rows were fed. As a result, the feed would get lost when you navigated away from the page via an action. From now on, a row will always be fed before row actions are executed.

#### Low-Code Apps: Custom icon of a low-code app without a draft version would not be displayed on the DataMiner landing page [ID_36277]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 - FR 10.3.7 -->

When a low-code app with a custom icon did not have a draft version, the DataMiner landing page would incorrectly not display the icon of that app.

#### Dashboards app: Height of 'DATA USED IN DASHBOARD' section would incorrectly change after collapsing and expanding it [ID_36282]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU16]/10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

When you collapsed and expanded the *DATA USED IN DASHBOARD* section of the *DATA* tab, in some cases, the height of that section would incorrectly change.

#### Monitoring app: Surveyor items would be sorted incorrectly [ID_36303]

<!-- MR 10.2.0 [CU16]/10.3.0 [CU4] - FR 10.3.7 -->

In the Surveyor of the Monitoring app, items of which the name contained a number would be sorted incorrectly. For example, *Element 2* would appear below *Element 11*. From now on, the items in the Surveyor of the Monitoring app will be sorted in the same way as those in the Surveyor of DataMiner Cube.
